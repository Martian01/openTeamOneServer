    <p>This page is a placeholder for the upcoming admin function.</p>
    <p>The minimum functionality should contain export and import of database content in JSON format, allowing for offline maintenance.
        Eventually it should enable the complete tenant configuration plus user and master data maintenance. </p>
    <p>It would be great if we could have a modern and pretty web app at some point, with smooth CSS animations and the like.
        This is defintely an area where experienced web developers can contribute. ^_^</p>
