# Open Team One Server

![Logo](src/main/resources/static/default/logo128.png)

Open Team One Server is a backend component to support the communication function of SAP Team One mobile apps. At this point in time the software is ready to be used productively.

## Scope

Open Team One Server aimes to provide a simple and functional solution of high performance for those needing a communication server under their own control - in terms of source code and operations. Instead of re-inventing the wheel we use freely available mobile clients, namely the SAP Team One mobile apps that are available for multiple platforms.

The SAP Team One apps are normally operated against a SAP Sports One backend that integrates communication with multiple sports applications. Typical examples are injury notifications, videos, questionnaires to capture user feedback and performance KPIs, and information packages combining media and editorials. All those integration scenarios are missing from Open Team One for the simple reason that Open Team One is a best-of-breed communication hub for mobile users, not a sports solution.

One function that cannot be provided for legal reasons are push notifications. The delivery of push notifications would require to reverse-engineer a secret API key.

## Limitations

Whilst the server is functionally complete within the scope described above, the user experience of the web apps for server administration and user self-service is still limited. Those web apps need a better user interaction & web design and a modern implementation resulting in a pleasant best-of-breed user experience.

## Quick Guide (How to run the server with demo content)

A running server instance consists of two data sources: the integrated relational database for structured objects, and the file system for potentially large images and file attachments. The structured objects in the database are sometimes referred to as "business objects". They can be exported and imported in a serialized JSON representation (but internally they strictly live as strongly typed Java objects). The entirety of the database can be exported and imported in the form of large JSON files, which can also be stored in the file system of the server.

Therefore, in order to bootstrap a demo server we need to provide a filesystem directory with content, including a JSON serialization of the database content. We then import the JSON file into the database, and voilÃ , the demo instance is ready.

### Step 1: Preparation

In step 1 you need to designate a data directory for the server, or rather, for the tenant that this server instance represents. In this example the directory chosen is /var/cache/openTeamOne but you are free to choose any other directory.

You copy the complete content of the project directory "demo" into the designated data directory. At the time of writing that would be the three subdirectories "attachments", "profiles" and "snapshots". The result should look like this:

### Step 2: Starting the Server

Next step is to start the server and log in to the admin section. Since this project is distributed as source code, you would import it as Java project into a suitable IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse. When asked for project types you would probably choose "Maven" since all dependencies are declared in a pom.xml file.

You would start the server by hitting the "execute" button of your IDE. Alternatively you can build and execute a JAR file on the command line, as layed out in a section below.

### Step 3: Login

When the server is running you call up the start page in a web browser. Assuming your server listens on TCP port 8080 (depends on your run configuration), you would enter the URL http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

The default administration login is user "admin" with password "admin".

### Step 4: Configuration

The server is smart enough to configure missing information when it starts up. There are not many configuration settings to begin with, and every setting can be changed by the administrator. However, there is one setting the server cannot guess: the data directory you have chosen in step 1.

So before you continue with anything, you need to make this directory known to the server. This is done by providing the tenant parameter "dataDirectory" and hitting the "Set" button, as shown in the following picture:

![Configuration](docu/demo3.png)

### Step 5: Import

In this step you import the database content of the demo instance from the JSON file "demo". If you followed the previous steps, the server will find it when you hit the "Load" button as in the following picture:

![Import](docu/demo4.png)

Congratulations! The demo instance is now operational.

### Step 6: Profit

The demo instance contains 3 users that you can log in as from your mobile devices. The user names are player01, player02 and player03. All 3 of them have the case-sensitive password "pass".

You can now familiarize yourself with the system by creating transactional content through mobile devices, and studying the database content using the admin functionality of the server. 

At this point in time the admin functionality is limited to the bare essentials. There are maintenance modules for the database tables available, allowing you to create, read, update & delete table entries (the so-called CRUD operations). There are database tables for tenant parameters, users, persons, rooms, room memberships, messages, files, viewed confirmations and subscriptions.

You can also export and import JSON snapshots of the database content. Note that a JSON file can be partial. For instance, if a JSON import contains only users and persons, it will not affect other object types in the database.

## Screenshots of Demo Content

Here are a few screenshots of SAP Team One connected against Open Team One Server, displaying the default demo content. The screenshots show the drawer, the landing page, the content of a room, the room details.

## Persistence via MariaDB

MariaDB is a popular MySQL fork. In fact, MariaDB is the continuation of MySQL by the original author and a community. MariaDB is drop-in compatible with MySQL, so everything written in this section works for MySQL, too.

For a first trial it is quite convenient to use the H2 in-memory database as it comes with Spring Boot and requires no configuration. It is also quite easy to switch to a disk based SQL database, like MariaDB. To do so, you first need to prepare an empty database for a standard user. Having started the database daemon, you simply enter the following three commands in any SQL console connected to the database, for instance the _mysql_ binary:

	mysql --password
	> create database teamone;
	> create user 'springuser'@'localhost' identified by 'dbPassword';
	> grant all on teamone.* to 'springuser'@'localhost';
	> quit

In this example the database is called _teamone_ and contains a user _springuser_ with password _dbPassword_. The database name, the user name and the password can be freely chosen. In a productive environment, once the database schema has been created, you are advised to reduce the granted authorizations to select, insert, update and delete.

Next you need to add the JDBC database driver to the project. We have already added the following dependency to our Maven file pom.xml:

	<dependency>
		<groupId>mysql</groupId>
		<artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
	</dependency>

So, for MariaDB or MySQL you don't need to do anything. If you use a different SQL database, you'll have to add the corresponding driver.

Finally we add the following properties to the application.properties file. In fact, you just need to uncomment them and insert the correct names and passwords, and maybe the TCP port of the database server.

	spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
	spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
	spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/teamone
	spring.datasource.username=springuser
	spring.datasource.password=dbPassword

Restart Open Team One Server and you're done. If you want to migrate the content over to the new DB, save and import a snapshot via the admin tools. 

Note: we ran into one issue when running the server against MariaDB, caused by a Java property that coincided with a protected SQL identifier. We solved the issue by re-naming the property.

## Building a JAR file

One of the most simple deployment options is to build a JAR file that can be executed anywhere. You simply call the Maven wrapper in the project root directory like this:

	$ ./mvnw package

This will build the project in the "target" directory and create two JAR files: One relatively small, containing only the project artefacts, the other one quite large, containing everything including the dependencies.

	-rw-r--r--  1 xxx users 30102998 Nov  9 00:53 openTeamOneServer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
	-rw-r--r--  1 xxx users   114474 Nov  9 00:53 openTeamOneServer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.original

The large JAR file can be copied to another machine and executed by a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) like this:

	java -jar openTeamOneServer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

## Web Application

Open Team One offers a web application for two user groups: administrators and users. There is a unified logon that is accessed by calling up server root, for instance http://localhost:8080 for a local installation.

Users will be taken to a self-service, where they can change their display names and their profile picture.

Administrators will be taken to a set of pages where they can browse and modify all tables and file attachments in the database. You have caught a glimpse of it in the quick guide section above.

Open Team One is designed to support different web applications, should there ever be more than one. The default web applikation is meant to be a fully functional proof-of-concept. It resides in the project directory src/main/resources/static/default/ and is served via the URL http://localhost:8080/default/ . Additional web applications can be placed into subdirectories that are sibling to src/main/resources/static/default/.

The server offers the following tenant parameters to control the navigation. The /ui/* services will automatically redirect to the targets specified by those tenant parameters. By overwriting them in the database you can set another web application as default.

| Tenant Parameter | Default value             | Usage                                      |
|------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| startPageNoLogon | /default/index.html       | when called without valid session context  |
| startPageLogon   | /default/index.html       | for logins that are neither admin nor user |
| startPageAdmin   | /default/admin/index.html | for logged-in administrators               |
| startPageUser    | /default/user/index.html  | for logged-in users                        |
